If you are interested in becoming a maintainer, get in touch with us by sending an email or opening an issue. You should already have code merged into the project. Active contributors are encouraged to get in touch.

Please note that all interactions in @okgrow's repos should follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/okgrow/guides/blob/master/open-source/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All commit messages should follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) message guidelines. In order to assist with this you can run `npm run-scripts commit` as a command has been added to the scripts section of the `package.json` file which will help guide formulation of a proper commit message.
