A field whose value conforms to the mongodb object id format as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/#ObjectId). This resolves to an [ObjectId](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/objectid.html) instance in your resolvers.
