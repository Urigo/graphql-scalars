# IPCPatent

The 'IPCPatent' scalar type represents a single International Patent Classification, as defined by
the parameters outlined by the
[World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/)

Any IPC Patent can be broken down into a hierarchical structure of four subsections

- **Section** designates the eight bodies of knowledge (labeled from A-H) which a patent generally
  belongs to. For patent _B01D 17/032_, **B** would be the Section designator.
- **Class** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a section, and is represented by two
  digits. For patent _B62D 21/00_, **62** would be the Class designator.
- **Subclass** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a class, and is represented by any
  character from A-Z. For patent _H04M 11/00_, **M** would be the Subclass designator.
- **Subgroup** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a subclass. It is separated from the
  sub class by a space and is represented by a sequence of characters consisting of two groups of
  digits separated by a "/" character. In a patent with the label _A61K 31/495_, **31/495** would be
  the Subgroup designator.
  - **Subgroup Part A** A sequence of 1 to 2 digits. For patent _A61K 31/495_, this would be **31**.
  - **Subgroup Part B** A sequence of 2 to 4 digits. For patent _A61K 31/495_, this would be
    **495**.
