# Installation

To get started with GraphQL Scalars, install the packages as follows:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-scalars
```

## Integration to your Existing GraphQL Schema

GraphQL Scalars is easy to integrate into your existing GraphQL Schema. You need to add a scalar
definition to your SDL type definitions and resolvers like below;

### In your SDL Type Definitions

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
scalar ScalarName
```

You can also import ready-to-use type definitions for scalars like below:

```ts
// or import specific typeDefs only with ES6 Import
import { ScalarNameTypeDefinition } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import specific typeDefs only with CommonJS
const { ScalarNameTypeDefinition } = require('graphql-scalars');
// or import all typeDefs once with ES6 Import
import { typeDefs as scalarTypeDefs } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import all typeDefs once with CommonJS
const { typeDefs: scalarTypeDefs } = require('graphql-scalars');

const typeDefs = [
  ...scalarTypeDefs,
  // other typeDefs
];
// or
const typeDefs = [
  ScalarNameTypeDefinition,
  // other typeDefs
];
```

### Importing it into your Resolver Map

You can either import the specific scalar's resolvers or all of the resolvers once.

```ts
// or import specific resolvers only with ES6 Import
import { ScalarNameResolver } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import specific resolvers only with CommonJS
const { ScalarNameResolver } = require('graphql-scalars');
// or import all resolvers once with ES6 Import
import { resolvers as scalarResolvers } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import all resolvers once with CommonJS
const { resolvers: scalarResolvers } = require('graphql-scalars');
```

### Adding to the Root Resolver Map

```ts
const myResolverMap = {
  ScalarName: ScalarNameResolver,

  Query: {
    // more stuff here
  },

  Mutation: {
    // more stuff here
  }
}
```

### Using it in your Type Definitions

That's it. Now you can use these scalar types in your schema definition like this:

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type Person {
  birthDate: DateTime
  ageInYears: PositiveInt
  heightInInches: PositiveFloat
  minimumHourlyRate: NonNegativeFloat
  currentlyActiveProjects: NonNegativeInt
  email: EmailAddress
  homePage: URL
  phoneNumber: PhoneNumber
  homePostalCode: PostalCode
}
```

These scalars can be used just like the base, built-in ones.

## GraphQL Code Generator Integration

```yaml filename="config.yml"
generates:
  ./src/graphql/types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
    config:
      scalars:
        JSON: string
        UUID: string
        Date: string
```
