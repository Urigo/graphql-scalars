# Usage with GraphQL-Yoga

To use `graphql-scalars` with GraphQL-Yoga, just add the scalars you need to the GraphQL schema, and
provide that schema to Yoga. No additional setup is needed.

```js
import { DateTimeResolver, DateTimeTypeDefinition } from 'graphql-scalars'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

export const schema = createSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    ${DateTimeTypeDefinition}
    type Query {
      time: DateTime
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    DateTime: DateTimeResolver
  }
})

// Create a Yoga instance with a GraphQL schema.
const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
```

You can find more information about GraphQL-Yoga in the
[documentation](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/v3).
