# Usage 

`graphql-scalars` provides generic `scalar` definition for JavaScript/TypeScript, that means you can use it with any GraphQL server implementation.

To use your scalars, start by importing the scalar the you wish to use, and add it to your GraphQL schema.

Each scalar provides a separate implementation (based on `GraphQLScalar` class of `graphql-js`), so you can use it with both schema-first and code-first approaches.

### Schema-first approach

Start by adding the scalar to your GraphQL SDL:

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
scalar ScalarName
```

Notw that you can also import ready-to-use type definitions for scalars like below:

```ts
// or import specific typeDefs only with ES6 Import
import { ScalarNameTypeDefinition } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import specific typeDefs only with CommonJS
const { ScalarNameTypeDefinition } = require('graphql-scalars');

const typeDefs = [
  ScalarNameTypeDefinition,
  // other typeDefs
];
```

Then, you can import the specific scalar's resolver:

```ts
// or import specific resolvers only with ES6 Import
import { ScalarNameResolver } from 'graphql-scalars';
// or import specific resolvers only with CommonJS
const { ScalarNameResolver } = require('graphql-scalars');
```

And add it to your resolver map:

```ts
const myResolverMap = {
  ScalarName: ScalarNameResolver,

  Query: {
    // more stuff here
  },

  Mutation: {
    // more stuff here
  },
};
```

### Code-first

With most code-first implementation, you can just import the scalar directly and add it to your schema as type.

```ts
import { GraphQLScalarName } from 'graphql-scalars';

// Now, use GraphQLScalarName as a type wihin your GraphQL Schema.
