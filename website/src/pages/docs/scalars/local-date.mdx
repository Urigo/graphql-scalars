# LocalDate

A local date string (i.e., with no associated timezone) in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, e.g. `2020-01-01`. The value is serialized and deserialized as a string as a signal to both clients and resolvers that special care must be taken with the value when converting it to any date/time type that includes a timezone, e.g., a JavaScript `Date`.
