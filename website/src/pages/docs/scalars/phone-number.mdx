# PhoneNumber

A field whose value conforms to the standard `E.164` format as specified in
[E.164 specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). Basically, this is `+17895551234`.
The very powerful
[`libphonenumber` library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) is available to take
_that_ format, parse and display it in whatever display format you want. It can also be used to
parse user input and _get_ the `E.164` format to pass _into_ a schema.
