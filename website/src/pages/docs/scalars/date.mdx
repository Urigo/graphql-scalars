# Date

A date string, such as `2007-12-03`, is compliant with the `full-date` format outlined in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339
profile of the ISO 8601 standard for the representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

This scalar is a description of the date, as used for birthdays for example. It cannot represent an instant on the
timeline.

## Result Coercion

JavaScript Date instances are coerced to an RFC 3339 compliant date string. Invalid Date instances raise a field error.

## Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant date strings are accepted, and are parsed into `Date` objects. All other input values raise a query
error indicating an incorrect type.
