# Date

A date string, such as `2007-12-03`, is compliant with the `full-date` format outlined in section
5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for the representation of dates and times using
the Gregorian calendar.

This scalar is a description of the date, as used for birthdays for example. It cannot represent an
instant on the timeline.

## Result Coercion

JavaScript Date instances are coerced to an RFC 3339 compliant date string, taken at the UTC
timezone. Invalid Date instances raise a field error.

Examples:

```js
new Date('2023-02-03T01:00:00Z') // 2023-02-03
new Date('2023-02-03T01:00:00+0500') // 2023-02-02
```

## Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant date strings are accepted, and are parsed
into `Date` objects at midnight UTC. All other input values raise a query error indicating an
incorrect type.
