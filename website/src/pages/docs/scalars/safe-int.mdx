# SafeInt

This scalar behaves just like the native `GraphQLInt` scalar, but it allows integers that require more than 32-bits. Any
integer that is considered "safe" in JavaScript (i.e. Â± `9,007,199,254,740,991`) is considered a valid value. But if you
need more than 52-bits, you should use `BigInt`.

The [GraphQL spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Int) limits its Int type to 32-bits. Maybe you've seen this
error before: [issue on graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/292).

<Callout>
  Based on [graphql-bigint](https://github.com/stems/graphql-bigint). Even though stems' implementation looks the same
  as the `BigInt` scalar, it is different because our `BigInt` implementation uses JavaScript's native `BigInt` type
  while `SafeInt` implementation doesn't support more than 52-bit integers.
