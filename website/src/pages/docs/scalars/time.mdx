# Time

A time string at UTC, such as `10:15:30Z`, is compliant with the `full-time` format outlined in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

This scalar is a description of a time instant such as the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange for example. It cannot represent an exact instant on the timeline.

This scalar ignores leap seconds (thereby assuming that a minute constitutes 59 seconds), in this respect, it diverges from the RFC 3339 profile.

Where an RFC 3339 compliant time string has a time zone other than UTC, it is shifted to UTC. For example, the time string `14:10:20+01:00` is shifted to `13:10:20Z`.

## Result Coercion

Javascript Date instances are coerced to an RFC 3339 compliant time string by extracting the UTC time part. Invalid Date instances raise a field error.

## Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant time strings are accepted. All other input values raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.
