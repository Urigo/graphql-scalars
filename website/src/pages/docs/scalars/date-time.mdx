# DateTime

A date-time string at UTC, such as `2007-12-03T10:15:30Z`, is compliant with the `date-time` format outlined in section
5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

This scalar is a description of an exact instant on the timeline such as the instant that a user account was created.

This scalar ignores leap seconds (thereby assuming that a minute constitutes 59 seconds). In this respect, it diverges
from the RFC 3339 profile.

Where an RFC 3339 compliant date-time string has a time-zone other than UTC, it is shifted to UTC. For example, the
date-time string `2016-01-01T14:10:20+01:00` is shifted to `2016-01-01T13:10:20Z`.

## Result Coercion

JavaScript Date instances and timestamps (represented as 32-bit signed integers) are coerced to RFC 3339 compliant
date-time strings. Invalid Date instances raise a field error.

## Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant date-time strings are accepted. All other input values raise a
query error indicating an incorrect type.
