# LocalEndTime

A local time string (i.e., with no associated timezone) in 24-hr `HH:mm[:ss[.SSS]]` format, e.g. `14:25` or `14:25:06` or `14:25:06.123`. The seconds and milliseconds portions are optional. This scalar is very similar to the `LocalTime`, with the only difference being that `LocalEndTime` also allows `24:00` as a valid value to indicate midnight of the following day. This is useful when using the scalar to represent the exclusive upper bound of a time block.
