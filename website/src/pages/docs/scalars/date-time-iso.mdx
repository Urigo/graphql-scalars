# DateTimeISO

A date-time string in ISO 8601 format, such as `2007-12-03T10:15:30Z`, specifically serialized as an
ISO string. This scalar extends the behavior of `DateTime` by ensuring that the serialized output is
always an ISO 8601 string.

## Result Coercion

JavaScript Date instances are coerced to an ISO 8601 compliant string. Invalid Date instances raise
a field error.

Examples:

```js
const date = new Date('2023-02-03T01:00:00Z')
// Outputs: "2023-02-03T01:00:00.000Z"
```

## Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant date-time strings are accepted. All other
input values raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.
