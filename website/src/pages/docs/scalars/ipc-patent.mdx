# IPCPatent

The 'IPCPatent' scalar type represents a single International Patent Classification, 
as defined by the parameters outlined by the [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/)

Any IPC Patent can be broken down into a hierarchical strucutre of four subsections 

- **Section** designates the eight bodies of knowledge (labeled from A-H) which a patent generally belongs to. For patent *B01D 17/032*, **B** would be the Section designator.
- **Class** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a section, and is represented by two digits. For patent *B62D 21/00*, **62** would be the Class designator.
- **Subclass** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a class, and is represented by any character from A-Z. For patent *H04M 11/00*, **M** would be the Subclass designator.
- **Subgroup** specifies a specific body of knowledge within a subclass. It is separated from the sub class by a space and is represented by a sequence of characters consisting of two groups of digits separted by a "/" character. In a patent with the label *A61K 31/495*, **31/495** would be the Subgroup designator.
  - **Subgroup Part A** A sequence of 1 to 2 digits. For patent *A61K 31/495*, this would be **31**.
  - **Subgroup Part B** A sequence of 2 to 4 digits. For patent *A61K 31/495*, this would be **495**.
