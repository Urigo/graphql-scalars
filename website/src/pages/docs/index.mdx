# Introduction

## What's this All About?

GraphQL is a wonderful new approach to application data and API layers that's gaining momentum. If
you have not heard of it, start [here](http://graphql.org/learn/) and check out GraphQL Tools docs
about [Custom scalars](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/scalars) as well.

However, for all of GraphQL's greatness, it is missing a couple of things that we have (and you might)
find very useful in defining your schemas. Namely GraphQL has a
[limited set of scalar types](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types), and we have found there
are some additional scalar types that are useful in being more precise in our schemas. Thankfully,
those sharp GraphQL folks provided a simple way to add new custom scalar types if needed. That's
what this package does.

GraphQL Scalars is a library of custom GraphQL scalar types for creating precise type-safe GraphQL schemas.

The GraphQL Specification has the `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean` and `ID` Scalar types by default. Those scalar types help you identify the data and validate it before transferring it between client and server. But you might need more specific scalars for your GraphQL application, to help you better describe and validate your appâ€™s data.

<Callout type="warning">
  We don't fault the GraphQL folks for these omissions. They have kept the core small and
  clean. Arguably not every project needs these additional scalar types. But _we_ have, and now _you_
  can use them too if needed.
</Callout>

## Why?

The primary purposes these scalars, really of _all_ types are to:

1.  Communicate to users of your schema exactly what they can expect or to at least _reduce_
    ambiguity in cases where that's possible. For example if you have a `Person` type in your schema
    and that type has as field like `ageInYears`, the value of that can only be null or a positive
    integer (or float, depending on how you want your schema to work). It should never be zero or
    negative.
1.  Run-time type checking. GraphQL helps to tighten up the contract between client and server. It
    does this with strong typing of the _interface_ (or _schema_). This helps us have greater
    confidence about what we're receiving from the server and what the server is receiving from the
    client.

This package adds to the base options available in GraphQL to support types that are reasonably
common in defining schemas or interfaces to data.

## Validation Using Scalars

For example, you have a `String` field, but you need to validate upcoming or ongoing string data using regular expressions. So you should have this validation on each end; one in the client, the other one in the server and maybe there is another on a source. Instead of duplicating the same logic in different parts of the project, you can use `EmailAddress` scalar type that does the validation inside GraphQL for you.

## Serialization and Parsing

The other benefit of using GraphQL scalar types is parsing and serializing while transferring data. For example, you have `DateTime` data, but it is transferred as `String` due to restrictions of JSON, and each time you receive and pass the data, you have to parse the string and create a JavaScript `Date` instance while also serializing it to string before passing it to the client. Instead of having that logic in your implementation, you can just use `DateTime` scalar, and you would work with native JavaScript `Date` instances directly like it is one of primitive types such as string, number and boolean.

## Thanks

This library was originally published as `@okgrow/graphql-scalars`.
It was created and maintained by the company `ok-grow`.
We, The Guild, took over the maintenance of that library [later on](https://the-guild.dev/blog/taking-over-merge-graphql-schemas).

We also like to say thank you to [@adriano-di-giovanni](https://github.com/adriano-di-giovanni) for being extremely generous and giving us the `graphql-scalars` name on npm which was previously owned by his own [library](https://github.com/adriano-di-giovanni/graphql-scalars).
